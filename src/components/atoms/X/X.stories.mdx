# X

The most powerful component from the design system. This is the FUTURE!

X component can exist as any HTML tag.

Remember, it uses all the theme settings as well as other components.

## Usage

Try using:

```tsx
<X.div>something here</X.div>
```

You can pass all the style props, see one example:

```tsx
<X.div bg='blue'>something here</X.div>
```

And you can pass css events and much more:

```tsx
<X.div bg={{ _: 'blue', hover: 'red' }}>something here</X.div>
```

See the docs for this feature [here](https://xstyled.dev/docs/hover-focus-other-states/).

This example running:

<Canvas>
  <X.div bg={{ _: 'blue', hover: 'red' }}>something here</X.div>
</Canvas>
