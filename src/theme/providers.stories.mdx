# Providers

The Design System exports the following provider component:

- ThemeProvider

This react provider is used at the root of your application to propagate and configure a custom color theme or styles.

## Usage

In your root component:

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@nexpy/design-system'

import App from './App'

const RootApp = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={yourCustomTheme}>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>
)

export default RootApp
```

**Important:** You don't need to set the whole theme from scratch.
Look `Docs/Settings/Theming` in this documentation for more information.

For more information about how to use and define the custom themes,
see the [themes](https://xstyled.dev/docs/theme/) section of xstyled
documentation. Take a look at how to change the specific default colors
of design system components in the `Docs/Settings/Default Colors` section.
