# Types

## VariantSystem

Type used to create extra props type of any component that uses the
getVariant function and all props provided by xstyled.

This type creates by default a type equivalent to this one:

```ts
import { ComponentProps } from 'react'
import { SystemProps } from '@xstyled/styled-components'

type Variants = 'foo' | 'bar'

type DivProps = {
  myCustomComponentProp: string
  variant?: Variants
} & SystemProps &
  ComponentProps<'div'>
```

And now, the same thing only using abstraction:

```ts
import { VariantSystem } from '@nexpy/design-system'

type Variants = 'foo' | 'bar'

type DivProps = VariantSystem<Variants, 'div'> & {
  myCustomComponentProp: string
}
```

Note that this type creates by default only the `variant` prop with you variant type and all props from xstyled.

Any other props, including other variants, must be declared as `myCustomComponentProp`.

## System

If you need all xstyled props and default element props but no variant prop use System type:

```ts
import { System } from '@nexpy/design-system'

type DivProps = System<'div'> & {
  myCustomComponentProp: string
}
```

## PropsWithAs

To make component typing less generic, the `as` and `forwardedAs` props was omitted
from the `VariantSystem` and `System` type constructors. If the `as` or `forwardedAs`
props exists, it is not possible to guess which identifier will be passed, so the
element is defined as generic automatically. If you need or prefer the one of the
props to be included in your component props typing, use `PropsWithAs`.

## WithChildren

Implements type of children (ReactNode) for use in React 18. You can pass other props with generics.

```ts
import { WithChildren } from '@nexpy/design-system'

type DivProps = WithChildren<{
  myCustomComponentProp: string
}>
```
