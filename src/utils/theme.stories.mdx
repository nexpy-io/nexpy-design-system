# Changing Default Colors

To change the default design system component colors, you can use the ThemeProvider,
but with specfic color name settings.

The design system works with some specific color names and you can change them by creating
colors with those same names in your custom theme to replace them.

The current system colors are:

<Canvas>
  <pre>{JSON.stringify(defaultColors, null, 4)}</pre>
</Canvas>

For convenience it is also possible to import a specific function to create this color object:

```ts
import { getOverrideSystemColors } from '@nexpy/design-system'
```

And now you can write your custom configuration:

```tsx
import { getOverrideSystemColors } from '@nexpy/design-system'

const customDesignSystemColors = getOverrideSystemColors({
  systemText: '#000000',
})

const myCustomTheme = {
  colors: {
    ...customDesignSystemColors,

    myAnotherColor: '#ee44ee',
  },
}


...


<ThemeProvider theme={myCustomTheme}>
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>

```

That's it!

For more information about how to use and define the custom themes,
see the [themes](https://xstyled.dev/docs/theme/) section of xstyled
documentation. Just be careful because the xstyled documentation was
doesn't go teach you what we taught above for this library here!
